# Introduction
This is one of a list of project required to complete my Udacity Nanodegree. This is the second project, called Popular Movies. Here, 
an api call is made to theMovieDB Api to get a list of all movies. And users will be able to specify how they want the list of movies 
sorted. Either by popularity or most rated.

# Technology
Android Studio, Java, Room, LiveData, ViewModel, AsyncTaskLoader

# Requirement
To make a call to theMovieDB Api, you have to go their website- https://www.themoviedb.org/, sign-up and generate an API_KEY. After you get
your API_KEY, open the NetworkUtils.java in package- com.emefilefrancis.popular_movies_1.Utilities, and assign your API_KEY to the final 
string holder named API_KEY.
